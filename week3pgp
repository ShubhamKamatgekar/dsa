1.Wave Array:
-----------
Given an sorted array arr[] of integers. Sort the array into a wave-like array(In Place). In other words, arrange the elements into a sequence such that arr[1] >= arr[2] <= arr[3] >= arr[4] <= arr[5] ..... and so on. If there are multiple solutions, find the lexicographically smallest one.

Note: The given array is sorted in ascending order, and modify the given array in-place without returning a new array.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: [2, 1, 4, 3, 5]
Explanation: Array elements after sorting it in the waveform are 2, 1, 4, 3, 5.
Input: arr[] = [2, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Output: [4, 2, 8, 7, 10, 9]
Explanation: Array elements after sorting it in the waveform are 4, 2, 8, 7, 10, 9.
Input: arr[] = [1]
Output: [1]
Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size ≤ 106
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤109

Expected Complexities
Time Complexity: O(n)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)

            arr[i] = arr[j];
            arr[j] = temp;
            i+=2;

3.Wave Array
---------------
You are given an array arr[] of size n - 1 that contains distinct integers in the range from 1 to n (inclusive). This array represents a permutation of the integers from 1 to n with one element missing. Your task is to identify and return the missing element.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 5]
Output: 4
Explanation: All the numbers from 1 to 5 are present except 4.
Input: arr[] = [8, 2, 4, 5, 3, 7, 1]
Output: 6
Explanation: All the numbers from 1 to 8 are present except 6.
Input: arr[] = [1]
Output: 2
Explanation: Only 1 is present so the missing element is 2.
Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 106
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ arr.size() + 1

2. Search Insert Position
Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 5
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 2
Output: 1
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 7
Output: 4
 
Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 104
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
nums contains distinct values sorted in ascending order.
-104 <= target <= 104


class Solution {
public:
    int searchInsert(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        int high = nums.size()-1;
        int low = 0;
        while(low <= high) {
            int mid = (low+high) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] == target) {
                return mid;
            } else if (nums[mid] < target) {
                low = mid+1;
            } else {
                high = mid-1;
            }
        }

        return low;
    }

};



3. Search in Rotated Sorted Array II
There is an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order (not necessarily with distinct values).
Before being passed to your function, nums is rotated at an unknown pivot index k (0 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,4,4,5,6,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 5 and become [4,5,6,6,7,0,1,2,4,4].
Given the array nums after the rotation and an integer target, return true if target is in nums, or false if it is not in nums.

You must decrease the overall operation steps as much as possible.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: false
 
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 5000
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
nums is guaranteed to be rotated at some pivot.
-104 <= target <= 104

Follow up: This problem is similar to Search in Rotated Sorted Array, but nums may contain duplicates. Would this affect the runtime complexity? How and why?

class Solution {
public:
    bool search(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        int low = 0;
        int high = nums.size() - 1;
        //cout << "low: "<<low<<" high: "<<high<<endl;

        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = (low + high) / 2;
            //cout << "low: "<<low<<" mid: "<<mid<<" high: "<<high<<endl;
            if (nums[mid] == target) {
                return true;
            }
            if (nums[low] == nums[mid] && nums[mid] == nums[high]) {
                low++;
                high--;
                continue;
            }

            if (nums[low] <= nums[mid]) {
                if (target >= nums[low] && target <= nums[mid]) {
                    high = mid-1;
                } else {
                    low = mid+1;
                }
            } else {
                if (target >= nums[mid] && target <= nums[high]) {
                    low = mid+1;
                } else {
                    high = mid-1;
                }
            }
        }

        return false;
    }
};

4. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array II
Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [0,1,4,4,5,6,7] might become:

[4,5,6,7,0,1,4] if it was rotated 4 times.
[0,1,4,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.
Notice that rotating an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 1 time results in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]].

Given the sorted rotated array nums that may contain duplicates, return the minimum element of this array.

You must decrease the overall operation steps as much as possible.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,5]
Output: 1
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,2,2,0,1]
Output: 0
 
Constraints:

n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 5000
-5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000
nums is sorted and rotated between 1 and n times.
 
Follow up: This problem is similar to Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array, but nums may contain duplicates. Would this affect the runtime complexity? How and why?

class Solution {
public:
    int findMin(vector<int>& nums) {
        int low = 0;
        int high = nums.size()-1;

        while(low < high) {
            int mid = (low+high) / 2;
            //if same shrink the search space
            if (nums[low] == nums[mid] && nums[mid] == nums[high]) {
                low++;
                high--;
                continue;
            }
            if (nums[mid] > nums[high]) {
                low = mid+1;
            } else {
                high = mid;
            }
        }

        return nums[low];
    }
};


7. Array Duplicates
Given an array arr[] of size n, containing elements from the range 1 to n, and each element appears at most twice, return an array of all the integers that appears twice.

Note: You can return the elements in any order but the driver code will print them in sorted order.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [2, 3, 1, 2, 3]
Output: [2, 3] 
Explanation: 2 and 3 occur more than once in the given array.
Input: arr[] = [3, 1, 2] 
Output: []
Explanation: There is no repeating element in the array, so the output is empty.
Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 106
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ n
Expected Complexities
Time Complexity: O(n)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)

//as all elemnts in an array of size n are in range 1 to n. We can negate the value of arr[arr[i]] to mark tht arr[i] is visited 
//next again when we find same value as arr[i] then when we check if arr[arr[i]] is -ve (<0) then we can say ar[i] is duplicate
//it might be possible that arr[i] itself was marked as -ve for some other number so we always check with abs val i.e arr[abs(arr[i])-1] coz 0 to n-1 range so -1
vector<int> findDuplicates(vector<int>& arr) {
     vector<int> result;
     
     for (int i=0; i<arr.size(); i++) {
         if (arr[abs(arr[i])-1] > 0) {
             arr[abs(arr[i])-1] = -arr[abs(arr[i])-1];
         } else {
             result.push_back(abs(arr[i]));
         }
     }
     
     return result;
 }
    

8. Single Element in a Sorted Array
You are given a sorted array consisting of only integers where every element appears exactly twice, except for one element which appears exactly once.
Return the single element that appears only once.
Your solution must run in O(log n) time and O(1) space.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,2,3,3,4,4,8,8]
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,3,7,7,10,11,11]
Output: 10
 
Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 105
0 <= nums[i] <= 105

class Solution {
public:
    int singleNonDuplicate(vector<int>& arr) {
        int low = 0;
        int high = arr.size()-1;
        while (low <high) {
            int mid = (low+high)/2;
            if (arr[mid] != arr[mid-1] && arr[mid] != arr[mid+1]) {
                return arr[mid];
            }

            if (arr[mid] == arr[mid+1]) {
                if (mid%2==1) {
                    high=mid-1;
                } else {
                    low = mid+2;
                }
            } else {
                if (mid%2==1) {
                    low=mid+1;
                } else {
                    high = mid-2;
                }
            }
        }

        return arr[low];
    }
};

9. Kth smallest element in the array using constant space when array can't be modified
Given an integer array arr[] and an integer k, your task is to find and return the kth smallest element in the given array.

Examples :

Input: arr[] = [10, 5, 4, 3, 48, 6, 2, 33, 53, 10], k = 4
Output: 5
Explanation: 4th smallest element in the given array is 5.
Input: arr[] = [7, 10, 4, 3, 20, 15], k = 3
Output: 7
Explanation: 3rd smallest element in the given array is 7.
Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 105
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 105
1 ≤ k ≤  arr.size() 

class Solution {
  public:
    /*
    int kthSmallest(vector<int> &arr, int k) {
        // code here
        priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> minH;
        for (int i=0; i<arr.size(); i++) {
            minH.push(arr[i]);
        }
        
        for (int i=0; i<k-1; i++) {
            minH.pop();
        }
        
        int ans = minH.top();
        minH.pop();
        return ans;
    }
    */

        //cout<<"bar: "<<bar<<endl;
        for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {
            if (arr[i] <= bar) {
                maxi = max(arr[i], maxi);
                k--;
                if (k==0) {
                    return maxi;
                }
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
    
    int kthSmallest(vector<int> &arr, int k) {
        int low = *min_element(arr.begin(), arr.end());
        int n = arr.size();
        int high = *max_element(arr.begin(), arr.end());
        while(low <= high) {
            int mid = (low+high) / 2;
            int countless = 0;
            int countequal = 0;
            
            for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {
                if (arr[i] < mid) {
                    countless++;
                } else if (arr[i] == mid) {
                    countequal++;
                }
            }

            } else if (countless<k && countless+countequal < k) {
                low = mid+1;
            }
        }
        
        return low-1;
    }
};



15. Find K-th Smallest Pair Distance:
-------------------------------------
The distance of a pair of integers a and b is defined as the absolute difference between a and b.
Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the kth smallest distance among all the pairs nums[i] and nums[j] where 0 <= i < j < nums.length.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,3,1], k = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: Here are all the pairs:
(1,3) -> 2
(1,1) -> 0
(3,1) -> 2
Then the 1st smallest distance pair is (1,1), and its distance is 0.
Example 2:

2. Search Insert Position
Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 5
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 2
Output: 1
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 7
Output: 4
 
Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 104
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
nums contains distinct values sorted in ascending order.
-104 <= target <= 104


class Solution {
public:
    int searchInsert(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        int high = nums.size()-1;
        int low = 0;
        while(low <= high) {
            int mid = (low+high) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] == target) {
                return mid;
            } else if (nums[mid] < target) {
                low = mid+1;
            } else {
                high = mid-1;
            }
        }

        return low;
    }

};



3. Search in Rotated Sorted Array II
There is an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order (not necessarily with distinct values).
Before being passed to your function, nums is rotated at an unknown pivot index k (0 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,4,4,5,6,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 5 and become [4,5,6,6,7,0,1,2,4,4].
Given the array nums after the rotation and an integer target, return true if target is in nums, or false if it is not in nums.

You must decrease the overall operation steps as much as possible.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: false
 
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 5000
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
nums is guaranteed to be rotated at some pivot.
-104 <= target <= 104

Follow up: This problem is similar to Search in Rotated Sorted Array, but nums may contain duplicates. Would this affect the runtime complexity? How and why?

class Solution {
public:
    bool search(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        int low = 0;
        int high = nums.size() - 1;
        //cout << "low: "<<low<<" high: "<<high<<endl;

        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = (low + high) / 2;
            //cout << "low: "<<low<<" mid: "<<mid<<" high: "<<high<<endl;
            if (nums[mid] == target) {
                return true;
            }
            if (nums[low] == nums[mid] && nums[mid] == nums[high]) {
                low++;
                high--;
                continue;
            }

            if (nums[low] <= nums[mid]) {
                if (target >= nums[low] && target <= nums[mid]) {
                    high = mid-1;
                } else {
                    low = mid+1;
                }
            } else {
                if (target >= nums[mid] && target <= nums[high]) {
                    low = mid+1;
                } else {
                    high = mid-1;
                }
            }
        }

        return false;
    }
};

4. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array II
Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [0,1,4,4,5,6,7] might become:

[4,5,6,7,0,1,4] if it was rotated 4 times.
[0,1,4,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.
Notice that rotating an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 1 time results in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]].

Given the sorted rotated array nums that may contain duplicates, return the minimum element of this array.

You must decrease the overall operation steps as much as possible.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,5]
Output: 1
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,2,2,0,1]
Output: 0
 
Constraints:

n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 5000
-5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000
nums is sorted and rotated between 1 and n times.
 
Follow up: This problem is similar to Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array, but nums may contain duplicates. Would this affect the runtime complexity? How and why?

class Solution {
public:
    int findMin(vector<int>& nums) {
        int low = 0;
        int high = nums.size()-1;

        while(low < high) {
            int mid = (low+high) / 2;
            //if same shrink the search space
            if (nums[low] == nums[mid] && nums[mid] == nums[high]) {
                low++;
                high--;
                continue;
            }
            if (nums[mid] > nums[high]) {
                low = mid+1;
            } else {
                high = mid;
            }
        }

        return nums[low];
    }
};


7. Array Duplicates
Given an array arr[] of size n, containing elements from the range 1 to n, and each element appears at most twice, return an array of all the integers that appears twice.

Note: You can return the elements in any order but the driver code will print them in sorted order.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [2, 3, 1, 2, 3]
Output: [2, 3] 
Explanation: 2 and 3 occur more than once in the given array.
Input: arr[] = [3, 1, 2] 
Output: []
Explanation: There is no repeating element in the array, so the output is empty.
Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 106
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ n
Expected Complexities
Time Complexity: O(n)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)

//as all elemnts in an array of size n are in range 1 to n. We can negate the value of arr[arr[i]] to mark tht arr[i] is visited 
//next again when we find same value as arr[i] then when we check if arr[arr[i]] is -ve (<0) then we can say ar[i] is duplicate
//it might be possible that arr[i] itself was marked as -ve for some other number so we always check with abs val i.e arr[abs(arr[i])-1] coz 0 to n-1 range so -1
vector<int> findDuplicates(vector<int>& arr) {
     vector<int> result;
     
     for (int i=0; i<arr.size(); i++) {
         if (arr[abs(arr[i])-1] > 0) {
             arr[abs(arr[i])-1] = -arr[abs(arr[i])-1];
         } else {
             result.push_back(abs(arr[i]));
         }
     }
     
     return result;
 }
    

8. Single Element in a Sorted Array
You are given a sorted array consisting of only integers where every element appears exactly twice, except for one element which appears exactly once.
Return the single element that appears only once.
Your solution must run in O(log n) time and O(1) space.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,2,3,3,4,4,8,8]
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,3,7,7,10,11,11]
Output: 10
 
Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 105
0 <= nums[i] <= 105

class Solution {
public:
    int singleNonDuplicate(vector<int>& arr) {
        int low = 0;
        int high = arr.size()-1;
        while (low <high) {
            int mid = (low+high)/2;
            if (arr[mid] != arr[mid-1] && arr[mid] != arr[mid+1]) {
                return arr[mid];
            }

            if (arr[mid] == arr[mid+1]) {
                if (mid%2==1) {
                    high=mid-1;
                } else {
                    low = mid+2;
                }
            } else {
                if (mid%2==1) {
                    low=mid+1;
                } else {
                    high = mid-2;
                }
            }
        }

        return arr[low];
    }
};

9. Kth smallest element in the array using constant space when array can't be modified
Given an integer array arr[] and an integer k, your task is to find and return the kth smallest element in the given array.

Output: 5
Explanation: 4th smallest element in the given array is 5.

        minH.pop();
        return ans;
    }
    */

            if (arr[i] <= bar) {
                maxi = max(arr[i], maxi);
                k--;
                if (k==0) {
                    return maxi;
                }
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
    
    int kthSmallest(vector<int> &arr, int k) {
        int low = *min_element(arr.begin(), arr.end());

    }
};

10.  Kth Smallest Element in a Sorted Matrix:
---------------------------------------------
Given an n x n matrix where each of the rows and columns is sorted in ascending order, return the kth smallest element in the matrix.
Note that it is the kth smallest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.
You must find a solution with a memory complexity better than O(n2).

Example 1:

Input: matrix = [[1,5,9],[10,11,13],[12,13,15]], k = 8
Output: 13
Explanation: The elements in the matrix are [1,5,9,10,11,12,13,13,15], and the 8th smallest number is 13
Example 2:

Input: matrix = [[-5]], k = 1
Output: -5

Constraints:
n == matrix.length == matrix[i].length
1 <= n <= 300
-109 <= matrix[i][j] <= 109
All the rows and columns of matrix are guaranteed to be sorted in non-decreasing order.
1 <= k <= n2

class Solution {

        int m = matrix.size();
        int n = matrix[0].size();
        int count = 0;
        int j = n-1;
        for (int i=0; i<m; i++) {
            if (matrix[i][n-1] <= mid) {
                count += n;
            } else {
                while(j>= 0 && matrix[i][j] > mid) {
                    j--;
                }
                
                count += j+1;
                j=n-1;
            }
        }

        return (count >= k);
    }

    int kthSmallest(vector<vector<int>>& matrix, int k) {
        int low = matrix[0][0];
        int n = matrix[0].size();

                ans = mid;
                high = mid-1;
            } else {

12. Aggessive Cows:
--------------------
You are given an array with unique elements of stalls[], which denote the positions of stalls. You are also given an integer k which denotes the number of aggressive cows. The task is to assign stalls to k cows such that the minimum distance between any two of them is the maximum possible.

Examples:

Input: stalls[] = [1, 2, 4, 8, 9], k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The first cow can be placed at stalls[0], 
the second cow can be placed at stalls[2] and 
the third cow can be placed at stalls[3]. 
The minimum distance between cows in this case is 3, which is the largest among all possible ways.
Input: stalls[] = [10, 1, 2, 7, 5], k = 3
Output: 4
Explanation: The first cow can be placed at stalls[0],
the second cow can be placed at stalls[1] and
the third cow can be placed at stalls[4].
The minimum distance between cows in this case is 4, which is the largest among all possible ways.
Input: stalls[] = [2, 12, 11, 3, 26, 7], k = 5
Output: 1
Explanation: There are 6 stalls and only 5 cows, we try to place the cows such that the minimum distance between any two cows is as large as possible.
The minimum distance between cows in this case is 1, which is the largest among all possible ways.
Constraints:
2 ≤ stalls.size() ≤ 106
0 ≤ stalls[i] ≤ 108

                k--;
                prev = stalls[i];
            }
        }
        if (k<=0) {
            return true;

        return false;
    }

        int n = stalls.size();
        if (n < k) {

15. Find K-th Smallest Pair Distance:

The distance of a pair of integers a and b is defined as the absolute difference between a and b.
Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the kth smallest distance among all the pairs nums[i] and nums[j] where 0 <= i < j < nums.length.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,3,1], k = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: Here are all the pairs:

17. Count Inversions
Difficulty: MediumAccuracy: 16.93%Submissions: 729K+Points: 4
Given an array of integers arr[]. You have to find the Inversion Count of the array. 
Note : Inversion count is the number of pairs of elements (i, j) such that i < j and arr[i] > arr[j].

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [2, 4, 1, 3, 5]
Output: 3
Explanation: The sequence 2, 4, 1, 3, 5 has three inversions (2, 1), (4, 1), (4, 3).
Input: arr[] = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
Output: 0
Explanation: As the sequence is already sorted so there is no inversion count.
Input: arr[] = [10, 10, 10]
Output: 0
Explanation: As all the elements of array are same, so there is no inversion count.
Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 105
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 104

void merge(vector<int> &arr, int s, int mid, int e, int &count) {
        int n1 = mid-s+1;
        int n2 = e-(mid);
        
        int a1[n1];
        int a2[n2];
        int k = s;
        for (int i=0; i<n1; i++) {
            a1[i] = arr[k++];
        }
        
        for (int i=0; i<n2; i++) {
            a2[i] = arr[k++];
        }
        int i=0;
        int j=0;
        k=s;
        while(i<n1 && j<n2) {
            if (a1[i] <= a2[j]) {
                arr[k] = a1[i];
                i++;
                k++;
            } else {

            k++;
            i++;
        }
        
        while (j<n2) {
            arr[k] = a2[j];
            k++;
            j++;
        }
    }
    
    void mergeSort(vector<int> &arr, int s, int e, int &count) {
        if (s >= e) {
           return;
        }
       
        int mid = (s + e) / 2;
        mergeSort(arr, s, mid, count);
        mergeSort(arr, mid+1, e, count);
        merge(arr, s, mid, e, count);
    }

        int count = 0;
        mergeSort(arr, low, high-1, count);
        return count;
    }



18.Segregate Even and Odd numbers:
----------------------------------
Given an array arr, write a program segregating even and odd numbers. The program should put all even numbers first in sorted order, and then odd numbers in sorted order.

Note:- You don't have to return the array, you have to modify it in-place.

Example:

Input: arr[] = [12, 34, 45, 9, 8, 90, 3]
Output: [8, 12, 34, 90, 3, 9, 45]
Explanation: Even numbers are 12, 34, 8 and 90. Rest are odd numbers.
Input: arr[] = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: [0, 2, 4, 1, 3]
Explanation: 0 2 4 are even and 1 3 are odd numbers.
Input: arr[] = [10, 22, 4, 6]
Output: [10, 22, 4, 6]
Explanation: Here all elements are even, so no need of segregataion
Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 106
0 ≤ arr[i] <=105

void segregateEvenOdd(vector<int>& arr) {
      int i=0;
      int j = arr.size()-1;
      
      while (i < j) {
          while (arr[i]%2 ==0) i++;
          while (arr[j]%2!= 0) j--;
          if (i<j) {
              int temp = arr[i];
              arr[i] = arr[j];
              arr[j] = temp;
          }
      }
      sort(arr.begin(), arr.begin()+i);
      sort(arr.begin()+i, arr.end());
  }

21. Kth Smallest Number in Multiplication Table
-----------------------------------------------
Nearly everyone has used the Multiplication Table. The multiplication table of size m x n is an integer matrix mat where mat[i][j] == i * j (1-indexed).
Given three integers m, n, and k, return the kth smallest element in the m x n multiplication table.

Example 1:
Input: m = 3, n = 3, k = 5
1 2 3 
2 4 6
3 6 9

sorted: 1 2 2 3 3 4 6 6 9
Output: 3
Explanation: The 5th smallest number is 3.

Input: m = 2, n = 3, k = 6
1 2 3
2 4 6
Output: 6
Explanation: The 6th smallest number is 6.

Constraints:
1 <= m, n <= 3 * 104
1 <= k <= m * n

bool check(int m, int n, int k, int mid) {
        int count = 0;
        //int j = n;
        for (int i=1; i<=m; i++) {
           // while (j>0 && (i*j > mid)) j--;
            //j=n;
           count += min(mid/i, n);
        }
        return (count >= k);
    }

    int findKthNumber(int m, int n, int k) {
        int low = 1;
        int high = m*n;
        int ans = 1;
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = (low + high) / 2;
            if (check(m, n, k, mid)) {
                ans = mid;
                high = mid-1;
            } else {
                low = mid+1;
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }

23. Nth Magical Number:
-------------------------
A positive integer is magical if it is divisible by either a or b.
Given the three integers n, a, and b, return the nth magical number. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.


Example 1:
Input: n = 1, a = 2, b = 3
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: n = 4, a = 2, b = 3
Output: 6
 
Constraints:

1 <= n <= 109
2 <= a, b <= 4 * 104

class Solution {
public:
    int gcd(int a, int b) {
        if (a==0) return b;
        if (b==0) return a;
        if (b>a) {
            b=b-a;
        } else {
            a=a-b;
        }
        return gcd(a,b);
    }

    long long lcm(int a, int b) {
        return (a*b)/gcd(a, b);
    }

    int nthMagicalNumber(int n, int a, int b) {
        long long high = 1LL * n * min(a, b);
        long long lm= lcm(a, b);

        int lim = 1e9 + 7;
        if (a==b) return (1LL * (a % lim) * (n % lim)) % lim;
        long long low = min(a, b);
        long long ans = 0;
        
        while(low <= high) {
            long long mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            long long c = mid / a + mid / b - mid / lm;
            if (c<n) {
                low = mid+1;
            } else {
                ans = mid;
                high=mid-1;
            }
        }
        return ans%lim;
    }
};

24.Count of Smaller Numbers After Self:
---------------------------------------
Given an integer array nums, return an integer array counts where counts[i] is the number of smaller elements to the right of nums[i].
Example 1:

Input: nums = [5,2,6,1]
Output: [2,1,1,0]
Explanation:
To the right of 5 there are 2 smaller elements (2 and 1).
To the right of 2 there is only 1 smaller element (1).
To the right of 6 there is 1 smaller element (1).
To the right of 1 there is 0 smaller element.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1]
Output: [0]
Example 3:

Input: nums = [-1,-1]
Output: [0,0]

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105

        int i=s;
        int j=mid+1;
        //store te sorted array pairs in thi temp vector then we will copy back to original nums after sorting (need some tmp space)
        vector<pair<int, int>> tmp;

        while(i<=mid && j<=e) {
            if (nums[i].first <= nums[j].first) {
                tmp.push_back(nums[j]);
                j++;
            } else {
                //if nums[i] > nums[j] then all values after nums[j] are also smaller than nums[i] as nums[j] are soted in desc order
                ans[nums[i].second] += e-j+1;//index starts from 0
                tmp.push_back(nums[i]);
                i++;
            }
        }

        while(i<=mid) {
            tmp.push_back(nums[i]);
            i++;
        }

        while (j<=e) {
            tmp.push_back(nums[j]);
            j++;
        }

        //restore num back with proper order
        for (int idx=0, k=s;k<=e;k++, idx++) {
           // cout<<tmp[idx].first<<" "; [1,9,7,8,5] --> after sort [9 8 7 5 1] (mege sort in des order so)
            nums[k] = tmp[idx];
        }
        cout<<endl;
    }

    void mergeSort(vector<pair<int, int>>& nums, int s, int e, vector<int>& ans) {
        if (s>=e) return;
        int mid = s + (e-s) / 2;

        mergeSort(nums, s, mid, ans);
        mergeSort(nums, mid+1, e, ans);
        merge(nums, s, e, mid, ans);
    }

    vector<int> countSmaller(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<int> ans(nums.size(), 0);
        //rather than just doing merge sort with the elements we wil also need index of each element to store the count in ans array
        //so we will modify the original nums array to use pair of value and its index than just value
        vector<pair<int, int>> mp;
